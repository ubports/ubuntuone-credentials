Ubuntu One Credentials QML Plugin

This plugin provides the UbuntuOne QML Component, which exposes the
CredentialsService plugin, allowing you to display login/register UI
and check for credentials and sign URLs.


HACKING

An example for embedding the UI provided by the plugin is in examples/embedding.qml

The CMake setup only builds the complete QML component at install, so
to test without installing to a system location, you will need to do
something like the following:

mkdir -p build 
cd build
cmake -D .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/tmp/installtemp .. 
make all install

Then, when running, point LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the install lib dir so
that libubuntuonecredentials is discoverable. Here's an example of running qmlscene to try the example code:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/installtemp/lib/ qmlscene -I /tmp/installtemp/lib/qt5/qml/ qml-credentials-service/examples/embeddingMain.qml
