HACKING

NOTE: if you are making changes to QML files in the plugin, remember
that they are copied over during the cmake configuration phase, and
the makefiles do not check for updated versions. If you change a QML
file, you must re-run cmake.

An example for embedding the UI provided by the plugin is in examples/embedding.qml
